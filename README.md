Quick Script to grab Hockey Logos


ESPN maintains a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that stores hockey logos.  An exammple url is:
- https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nhl/500/ana.png&h=512&w=512

This repo stores example scripts for running batch operations on the url to grab a logo for each team.

**NOTE: Using this script potentially violates copyright, trademark, and terms of use agreements for the NHL and ESPN.**  
*use only for personal/non-professional situations, such as putting an image into a homemade spreadsheet to track hockey tickets*
